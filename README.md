Unit 2

# Basketball Team Stats Tool

This project was to take a take players and put them on teams. 3 experienced and 3 
inexperienced players per team. I was to have a menu with options to select Team Stats 
or Quit the program. If the user choose to see Team Stats, Then provide another menu 
with team name to choose from. Once a team was choose I was to have this displayed, Example:
Team: Panthers
Players: 6
Experienced players: 3
Inexperienced players:3
Player names: example, example, example, example, example, example
Player guardians: example, example, example, example, example, example
Avergae height: 43.5"

Then I was to ask if the user would like to see another teams stats, if they did return
to the main menu, if they didnt exit the program.

This was a tough project as I struggled with lists and dictionaries, but now I feel 
way better at using them and getting items out of them or even creating new lists and
appending items to them. Check it out and see what you think! Hope you enjoy!
